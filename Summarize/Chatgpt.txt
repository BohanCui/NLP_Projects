ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence chatbot, continues to have internet users abuzz, given its ability to answer prompts on a stunning variety of subjects, to create songs, recipes, and jokes, to draft emails, and more.

“It’s amazing to have this technology do in seconds what it takes many of us hours to do,” says Deborah Rossen-Knill, executive director of the University of Rochester’s Writing, Speaking, and Argument Program and a professor of writing studies. “There’s just an endless set of possibilities.”

Those endless possibilities, however, have faculty and administrators in higher education expressing anxiety as well as awe, because ChatGPT also can write essays and code, answer homework questions, and solve math problems.

“We’re all trying to figure out how it fits into the existing landscape of higher education,” says Rachel Remmel, assistant dean and director of the University’s Teaching Center. “Everyone is talking about it.”

ChatGPT—the GPT stands for “generative pretrained transformer”—was launched by OpenAI in November 2022. It reached one million users in five days, according to OpenAI’s cofounder Sam Altman, and surpassed 100 million after two months, making it the fastest-growing consumer application in history.

And more is coming. Google is nearing the public release of a rival to ChatGPT called Bard.

“The one thing I’m sure of is ChatGPT and others like it are here to stay,” says Christopher Kanan, an associate professor in the Department of Computer Science. “And we, as educators, will just have to deal with that.”

Rochester faculty and administrators offered their thoughts on how they’re dealing with ChatGPT—and how it may affect teaching and learning down the road.
